#+TITLE: Visualizing System Architecture with Babashka and Mermaid

* Talk Abstract

Explore how Babashka scripts can dynamically generate Mermaid diagrams to
visualize system architectures, data flows, and deployment topologies. Learn
techniques for turning infrastructure-as-code into visual documentation.

* Key Points

- Dynamic diagram generation from system metadata
- Integrating Mermaid with Babashka workflows
- Automating architecture documentation
- Use cases: cloud infrastructure, microservices, data pipelines

* Why This Matters

Architecture diagrams often become outdated. Generate them from actual
system state using Babashka to ensure documentation stays synchronized
with reality.

* Demo Ideas

1. Query AWS/GCP resources and generate architecture diagram
2. Parse Kubernetes manifests and create service mesh visualization
3. Build dependency graphs from project files
4. Create sequence diagrams from log analysis

* Code Example

#+begin_src clojure
(ns mermaid-gen
  (:require [babashka.process :as p]
            [clojure.string :as str]))

(defn k8s-to-mermaid
  "Convert Kubernetes resources to Mermaid diagram"
  [namespace]
  (let [resources (-> (p/shell {:out :string}
                               "kubectl get all -n" namespace)
                      :out)]
    ;; Parse and generate Mermaid syntax
    ))
#+end_src
