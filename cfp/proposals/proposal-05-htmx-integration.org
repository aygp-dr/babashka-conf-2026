#+TITLE: Modern Web Development: Babashka + HTMX for Hypermedia Applications
#+AUTHOR: Your Name
#+DATE: 2025-11-23

* Talk Abstract

Build modern, interactive web applications using Babashka as a backend with
HTMX for dynamic frontend interactions. Explore how this combination provides
a lightweight alternative to heavy JavaScript frameworks while maintaining
rich interactivity.

* Key Points

- Hypermedia-driven application architecture
- Server-side rendering with Hiccup
- HTMX patterns: lazy loading, infinite scroll, modals
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Deployment as a single binary

* Why This Approach

- Minimal JavaScript complexity
- Fast development iteration
- Single-file deployment
- Excellent for internal tools, dashboards, and admin interfaces

* Demo Application

Build a task management app:

#+begin_src clojure :tangle ../code/examples/htmx-demo.bb
#!/usr/bin/env bb

(require '[org.httpkit.server :as server])
(require '[hiccup.core :as h])

(defn render-tasks [tasks]
  (h/html
   [:div#task-list
    (for [task tasks]
      [:div.task
       [:span (:title task)]
       [:button {:hx-delete (str "/tasks/" (:id task))
                 :hx-target "#task-list"
                 :hx-swap "outerHTML"}
        "Delete"]])]))

(defn handler [req]
  ;; Route handling
  )

(server/run-server handler {:port 8080})
#+end_src

* Target Audience

Full-stack developers interested in simpler web architectures and those
building internal tools or MVPs.
